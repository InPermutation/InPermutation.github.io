title: Teach One Thing
---

Every programming language or paradigm has one truly valuable thing to teach us.

FORTRAN teaches that computers are really good for scientific applications.

COBOL teaches that computers can also be good at business applications.

C teaches that a thin layer of abstraction can make any computer programmable from the same source code.

LISP teaches that code can be data.

The von Neumann architecture teaches a model for understanding computation:
a CPU and some linear-addressable memory, holding data and code.

Functional programming, however, teaches that there are alternatives to von Neumann architecture:
recursive evaluation of expressions.

Scala teaches that object-oriented programming and functional programming are insanely compatible.

Haskell teaches that type safety doesn't need to imply indecipherable runes.
