I have been busy around the Internet!

This summer, I wrote two posts on the company blog about how I spent my spring: [Killing Off Wasabi - Part 1][1], and [Part 2][2].

This led to [Scott Hanselman interviewing me on Hanselminutes][3].

And today, [Jell published an interview with me][4] about how we work at [Fog Creek][5].
