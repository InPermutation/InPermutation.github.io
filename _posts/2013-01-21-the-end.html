<p>My heart sank when <a href="http://www.scottporad.com/" title="Scott Porad" target="_blank">Scott</a> made the announcement on the first evening of CheezCon Winter 2012 -- he planned on <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2012/cheezburgers-tech-whiz-scott-porad-depart-company/" title="Cheezburger's tech whiz Scott Porad to depart the company" target="_blank">leaving Cheezburger</a> at the end of the year. Scott represented our department to the board and the rest of the executive team. He hired all but one of us. He built a culture around remote work, and set precedent in lots of subtle ways. For example, around 2010, while we were chatting about something, he proposed a change in the way we referred to teams: instead of naming them after the product manager the developers worked with, why not act like sports organizations and have team names? I thought it was a silly attempt at morale boosting, sort of like allowing posters on the cubicle walls*. But after trying it for a while, I realized that it made sense. A team shouldn't be renamed just because its linebacker retired, it should keep its name season after season. Thus were born Derpakiin, Adventure Team, the Hipsters, Da <a href="https://twitter.com/rumplesthebear" title="Rumples the Bear" target="_blank">Bears</a>, and IO. The team names were a great idea.</p>
<p>At the announcement, Scott went around the room and said one nice thing about each person in the department. He told me I was probably the smartest person in the room. (You know what they say about being the smartest person in a room.) I think he said "probably" because <a href="http://stefan.rusek.org/" title="Stoffers Moosek" target="_blank">Stefan</a> was also in the room, so he couldn't be sure. Just hearing all the short stories reminded me how we were networked together by a single node. Losing the node wouldn't destroy the network, but it would drastically reshape it. I couldn't imagine CheezTech without Scott. He ended up leaving before the year was up, in late November. They are replacing him with a pair of vice presidents.</p>
<p>I left mid-December. Five others left that month. Three more left this January. Half the Scott-CheezTech network has disconnected, and reconnected elsewhere. Motorsports, writing, a winery, events for kids,&nbsp;deep-space mining, consulting, big data, teaching.</p>
<p>There are a lot of smart people still on that network. I will miss visiting everyone in Seattle. I hope we connect again.</p>
