<p>Have you seen <a href="http://work.repponen.com/iOS-86">iOS '86</a>? The idea behind it: what would happen if designers from the Macintosh System Software team in 1986 were to get their hands on a (somehow monochrome) iPhone 4S? It's a pretty neat idea, but I disagree with Anton on a few details. On the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_Macintosh_Desktop.png">original Macintosh desktop</a>, there are rounded rectangles in every corner to make the screen look less sharp and more friendly. Also, I don't think the Springboard bar would have a 3d effect, so I made it into a more contemporary shaded rectangle.&nbsp;I also disagree with the chosen icon weight: Susan Kare overwhelmingly chose to use white icons with black features, and inverting this pattern represented a selected item. In iOS '86, therefore, apps should appear mostly white until clicked.</p>
