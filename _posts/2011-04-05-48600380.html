<div class='post_body'><p>I will never watch every movie on my Netflix queue. The Kindle bookstore has a thousand times more books than I will read in my lifetime, with more being published each day, and the library is right down the street. My phone buzzes every few minutes to politely announce a new email. Even if I limit myself to single-player video games with a linear storyline, I'm already a century behind. Every time I load my Facebook news feed, there is more to see.</p>
<p>There is a neverending torrent of worthy pursuits, and yet my night can be summarized as reading the dull comments on a blog I didn't even like that much. Why did I burn my limited free time on something so insipid? Reddit is not an acceptable hobby.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough great work out there that you don&rsquo;t need to waste any time with anything that isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Return your unopened red envelopes,&nbsp;stop paying for Pandora,&nbsp;sell all your books, redirect Hacker News to localhost, turn off your Xbox, get rid of cable TV. Go empty the trash, get a breath of fresh spring air, come back here, and sit back down.</p>
<p>What is the best thing you can think of doing right now? I'm not asking you what would have the most impact on the world; you should do that at work tomorrow. You earned this little moment of free time. It's the only free time you get today.&nbsp;What would make you happiest?</p>
