I've been a long-time fan of [two-factor authentication][2fa],
using Google Authenticator to represent "something I have"
in addition to the password, which is "something I know."
So, of course, when [GitHub added two-factor authentication][GitHub],
I immediately enabled it on my account.

Last night, unable to sleep, I noticed an update to Google Authenticator
in the App Store. This is an app that hasn't been updated for several years,
so I was curious to see what the improvements were. I opened the app, and all
of my tokens had vanished. Sure enough, 
[Calvin reported the same issue on Hacker News][calvin].
This SNAFU, in addition to my growing distrust of Google, 
inspired me to try and find a new, non-Google
app to authenticate. I also decided to learn how it worked. Luckily, 
the algorithm&mdash;the 
[Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm][TOTP]
**(TOTP)**&mdash;is very simple. 

#### Sharing Secrets...

First, your authenticator app and the server must agree on a shared secret.
The most common way this happens is that the server generates a secret
and then displays a [QR code][QR] to scan.

<div style="width: 300px; border: 1px solid #555; padding: 10px; border-radius: 7px; text-align: center; margin:auto">
<img src="/otpauthexample.png" alt="The QR code for this URI" /><br />
<tt>otpauth://totp/$LABEL?secret=$SECRET</tt>
</div>

`LABEL` can be used to describe the key in your app, while `SECRET` is
the 16-character [base32][base32]-encoded shared secret, which is now
known to both the client and the server.

#### ...But Don't Share With Everyone

Now, a shared secret is a pretty weak method of authentication, because
the user can memorize it, effectively making it "something I know."
Also, a man-in-the-middle attack is alarmingly easy: the client will
just *tell you* its secret!

A [hash][hash] of the secret proves that we know it, without revealing
what the secret is, but is still susceptible to a replay attack because
the hash of the secret will never change. So an additional "moving factor"
is combined with the shared secret in a
[hash-based message authentication code][HMAC] (HMAC)
&mdash;specifically `HMAC-SHA-1`.

In [HOTP][HOTP], a predecessor to TOTP, the moving factor is a
simple 8 byte counter. In TOTP, the moving factor is the passage of time!
(That's why it is called the *time-based* one-time password algorithm.)
The two algorithms are otherwise identical; in fact, TOTP is defined as
an extension to HOTP.

TOTP uses Unix time (roughtly the number of seconds that have passed since
January 1, 1970 GMT) to measure time. Since this would cause a new code
to be generated each second, a time step `X=30` is defined by default,
meaning a new code is only generated every 30 seconds so that users have
enough time to type in the code after it has been generated.

#### Aside: latency and clock skew
The Internet can be slow, and clocks might not match exactly, so some
leniency is allowed. [RFC6238][TOTP] recommends looking an extra time
step in either direction, which essentially opens the window from
30 seconds to 90 seconds.

#### Computing a one-time code

The `HMAC-SHA-1` algorithm is run with the secret key and the current
time step:


<div style="border: 1px solid #555; padding: 10px; border-radius: 7px; text-align: center; margin:auto">
<tt style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px">
HMAC-SHA-1(SECRET, time()/30) =
</tt>
<tt style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px">
1f|86|98|69|0e|02|ca|16|61|85|50|ef|7f|19|da|8e|94|5b|55|5a
</tt>

<b>HS</b> is a 160-bit message authentication code.
</div>

We could use this directly, but the user would have to type in an
approximately 49-digit number every time they want to authenticate.
(Plus, they would have to type this number, error-free, in 30 seconds!)

The code is shortened to 31 bits with **dynamic truncation**:

The offset is defined as the lower 4 bits of the last byte.
The last byte of `HS` is hex `5a`; its lower 4 bits are therefore hex `a`
(decimal ten).

Smoosh together the 4 bytes starting at offset 10:

<div style="border: 1px solid #555; padding: 10px; border-radius: 7px; text-align: center; margin:auto">
<tt style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px">
1f|86|98|69|0e|02|ca|16|61|85|<b>50|ef|7f|19</b>|da|8e|94|5b|55|5a
</tt>

<tt style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px">
0x50ef7f19
</tt>
<b>DBC1</b>, Dynamic Binary Code #1
</div>

And truncate it further to a 31-bit number by making sure the top bit is cleared
(in this case, it already is, so the number does not change):

<div style="border: 1px solid #555; padding: 10px; border-radius: 7px; text-align: center; margin:auto">
<tt style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px">
0x50ef7f19
</tt>
<b>DBC2</b> (same as DBC1)
</div>

Then convert that value to a decimal number:

<div style="border: 1px solid #555; padding: 10px; border-radius: 7px; text-align: center; margin:auto">
<tt style="display:block;margin-bottom:5px">
1357872921
</tt>
<b>Decimal Code</b>
</div>

And show the last 6 digits:

<div style="border: 1px solid #555; padding: 10px; border-radius: 7px; text-align: center; margin:auto">
<h3><tt>872921</tt></h3>
<b>TOTP</b>
</div>

The user types this in. The server performs the same calculation and compares
the values. If they match, the server knows that the user has possession
of the authenticator device, and they can be authenticated. If not, the
server knows the current session is invalid. In less than 30 seconds, the
time step will increment, and the code will change.

#### Simple!
With a few simple building blocks, a token-based form of authentication is
made using only software. With a password, the user now has two-factor
authentication and will be less susceptible to many types of attacks.
