<div class='post_body'><p>Back in 2009, Paul Graham wrote about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" title="Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule">Makers and Managers</a>, and how their schedules differ. I try very hard to remain on a Maker's Schedule, but in a mostly-remote company like mine, it is very difficult and even antisocial to avoid speaking with your teammates. Unfortunately, I am the sort of person who feels compelled to click the little red badges on my iPhone. Campfire and Skype have the same effect on me: no matter the subject, I am strongly motivated to pay attention and reply often. I'm constantly <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html" title="Human Task Switches Considered Harmful">switching tasks</a> between work and communication, which is starting to eat away at any hope of productivity.</p>
<p>This week, I'm going to try an experiment: I will be deliberate with my time. Today I started at 9, and spent 3.5 hours shuffling email and talking to coworkers. That's my communication and teamwork quota; now it's time to be asocial and write some dang code. Campfire and Skype will both be hidden, but I will still be interruptible by people who are looking for me. I assume that they know about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html" title="The Joel Test">quiet working conditions</a>, so I can trust that any interruptions that knock me out of the zone are worthwhile.</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>I love how you're calling this out. One thing: To qualify as an experiment, you need a testable hypothesis. What's yours?</div>

<div class='response_body'>Justin: Great question. My hypothesis is that I will not feel as burned out at the end of every work day. (It's a really objective hypothesis, I know!)</div>
