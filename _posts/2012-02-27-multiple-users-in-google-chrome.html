<p>Like Private Browsing, Chrome now has a feature where you can have <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2364824">multiple browser sessions</a> running side-by-side. This is very excellent, because it means you can be logged in to the same site as two different users. I use it to keep my work bookmarks and Facebook account separate from my personal account. The most important piece of the puzzle fell into place today when I found out the keyboard shortcut for switching between accounts:&nbsp;Ctrl+Shift+M, or on Mac, âŒ˜-Shift-M. Now I can switch between accounts even more quickly.</p>
