<p>Programming involves a lot of the same motions as horse stall mucking. We're all just shoveling parameters from one function call to the next. Occasionally, I can even see through a hole in the barn the types of work we are meant to be doing: galloping through the bluegrass.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs often said computers are like a bicycle for the mind. He was right, but only because we are still in the penny-farthing era of computation. My mind can go faster than this, I know it. I just don't know how the supersonic jet of the mind works, yet.</p>
