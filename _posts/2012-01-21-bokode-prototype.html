<p>I got an itch to reproduce MIT Media Lab's <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~ankit/bokode/" title="Imperceptible Visual Tags for Camera Based Interaction from a Distance" target="_blank">Bokode</a>, a really clever optical hack. Their system uses an LED, a diffuser, an image screen, and a pinhole lens. I don't have the components on hand to make something as small as an actual Bokode, but I do have enough camping and cooking gear to smush together a prototype.</p>
<p>My light source was a&nbsp;MAGLITE&reg; LED 3-Cell D Flashlight. I poked some holes in aluminum foil with a mechanical pencil, but I'm not nearly dexterous enough to make an actual QR code. Between the light and the aluminum foil, I inserted a sheet of Kleenex to act as a diffuser. Finally, I reused the pinhole lens I made for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.551497198323.2038591.29200731" title="DIY pinhole lens (private Facebook)" target="_blank">previous experiment</a>&nbsp;as the lens.</p>
<p>I metered, focused at infinity, and took this picture:</p>
