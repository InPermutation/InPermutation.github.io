<p><em>This is the second of a three-part series:&nbsp;<a href="http://jacob.jkrall.net/fizzbuzz-without-multiplication-or-division">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://jacob.jkrall.net/fizzbuzz-without-multiplication-or-division-p-0">Part 3</a>.</em></p>
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://jacob.jkrall.net/fizzbuzz-without-multiplication-or-division">Last time</a> on Lost In Permutation, I wrote a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/fizzbuzz-the-programmers-stairway-to-heaven.html" title="FizzBuzz: the Programmer's Stairway to Heaven">FizzBuzz</a> implementation that didn't use the run-time multiplication and division operators. Unfortunately, magic numbers make me squeamish, and there is too much coupling between the data in <tt>rg</tt> and the if-chain. In order to change the behavior of the function, I would have to change both places.</p>
<p>To fix this, I can use <tt>printf()</tt> (which doesn't care if I pass an extra parameter) as the dispatcher. The more decisions I can foist onto the runtime, the less code I have written, which is great because it means I have less code to test, less code to read, and less code to maintain.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>void FizzBuzz(int n) {
  char* num = &quot;%d\n&quot;;
  char* fizz = &quot;Fizz\n&quot;;
  char* buzz = &quot;Buzz\n&quot;;
  char* fizzbuzz = &quot;FizzBuzz\n&quot;;

  char* rg[15] = { fizzbuzz, num, num, fizz, num, buzz, fizz, num, num, fizz, buzz, num, fizz, num, num };
  int ix = 1;

  for(int i=1; i&lt;=n; i++)
  {
     printf(rg[ix], i);
     
     ix++;
     if(ix==15) ix = 0;
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>Now there is no longer an if-chain that needs to be tested, only the prepopulated data in the ring buffer <tt>rg</tt> and the behavior of the ring buffer itself. Except for the magic constant 15, the only place to make changes to the function is in <tt>rg</tt> itself. When this series concludes, I will examine how to expand this printf-dispatch solution for any variant of the FizzBuzz problem.</p></div>
